JavaScript library for getting Medium feeds (user, topic, or tag) as JSON.

## What

Get Medium feeds as JSON. Also check out [Ghosts/medium-feed][mf] because it may suit your needs better.

## Why

Because [@Ghosts](https://github.com/Ghosts) was writing [medium-feed][mf]. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

## How

Via npm or unpkg:
- `npm install meed`
- https://unpkg.com/meed

For local(host) testing in a browser, you'll probably need a CORS proxy. Here's a list: https://gist.github.com/jimmywarting/ac1be6ea0297c16c477e17f8fbe51347
